Hi, if you add this code to any compiler or an HTML widget on Elementor, you will see a vertical navigation menu that is aligned to the right and centered on your web page. You can change the icons inside the squares from within the code, and customize the code as you wish.

If you need any assistance, you can email me at alibugatekin@gmail.com.

Have a good day :)
